# Project UD1
My main goal in this project was to make a UI that could encrypt and decrypt
things using various different ciphers. I initially aimed for 2 ciphers, but finding
a block cipher that wasn't excessively technical was challenging. I do not have a
strong background in linear algebra or cryptography so anything advanced is
out of question. I settled on the RC4 cipher eventually. I was aiming to also
put the AES cipher in using the javax.crypto library, but even that was a headache.
More notes about why it didn't work are in the AES.java file. Overall, my user experience 
to allow users to encrypt and decrypt and import/export that to files 
was accomplished.
